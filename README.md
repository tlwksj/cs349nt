### Group 3: Nutrition Tracking App
#### Team Members: Jahlil Owens, Landon Strappazon, and Trishelle Leal
The project involves the creation of a nutrition-tracking app, which would allow users to
log their daily dietary intake, and monitor their progress. This project aims to facilitate the
tracking of food intake by integrating food logging, meal planning, and a recipe database, to help
users fulfill their fitness goals. The app would also feature dietary suggestions and detailed
analytics that would help the users optimize their health and fitness journey.
